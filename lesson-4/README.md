# Lesson 4: Tying Everything Together

## Prerequisites
Before starting this lesson, you should have already completed lesson 1, 2, and 3. At this point, you should have a better understanding of how React and React Native works as well as how to implement key mobile features like lists, navigation, networking, and etc.

## Introduction
Over the last few weeks, you've built a variety of different apps. From a basic tip calculator app to a book search application, we've explored a number of different concepts and ideas. This week, we invite you to try building an application on your own! You have access to the source code for multiple different React Native applications. You are free to use code from these apps to integrate in your own

In addition, in the lesson-4 folder, we provided a basic `cashout` application that integrates many of the concepts we talked about previously. `cashout` is an application for keeping track of transactions. In our app, we can store details about how much we lost/gained, who the transaction was with, and reasons/details for why it happened. Overall, this app is pretty simple and isn't anything too different from what we've done in the past. If you're uncomfortable about building an app totally from scratch, feel free to use `cashout` as a base to work off of 

**If you can't finish in-time during this weeks lesson, tag us in GitHub OR contact a member of e-board**

## Potential Ideas:
* Four function calculator
* To-do list application
* Weather application (You can find APIs online)
* Random joke generator (You can find APIs online)
* GitHub search app (Similar to librarian. GitHub's API is online and free to use)
* Extend `cashout`
* Calorie counting app
* Tinder clone (Using dummy data that is hard-coded in)
* Travel destination catalog app (Using data that is hard-coded in)

The app you build can be as simple as a single view app that responds to a button press or as complex as an app that passes data between several screens. 

We want to see you be creative and apply the concepts we've taught you so far. We're excited to see what you come up with, good luck!

## Challenges:

### Setup
* [5 points] Use the `create-react-native-app` CLI to set up your application

### Components
* [5 points] Use `<TextInput>` in your application
* [5 points] Use `<Button>` in your application
* [7 points] Use `<TouchableHighlight>` in your application in place of `<Button>`
* [10 points] Use `<FlatList>` in your application
* [15 points] Use a custom component that you define on your own
* [10 points] Simple use of styles in your application (ex: changing font size, text color, etc)
* [15 points] Advanced use of styles in your application (and not just change the color of text or something simple)
* [10 points] Pass a function as a prop to a child component
* [5 points] Use JSX ternary operators in your code (Ex: `(value) ? (do this if true) : (do this if false)`)

### Networking
* [15 points] Use the `fetch()` API to add networking to your application
* [20 points] Use the `fetch()` API to make a POST request 

### Navigation
* [15 points] Use the StackNavigator in your app to navigate between different screens (reminder: you will have to run `npm install --save react-navigation` to install the package necessary)
* [10 points] Pass data from one screen to another
* [20 points] Use a navigator we haven't learned about 

### Other
* [10 points] Use a component we haven't used in a lesson before
* [20 points] Use a 3rd party React Native library you found online
