# Scope Fall 2017: React Native

This is the Scope Fall 2017 GitHub curriculum repository! Here you'll find projects and resources that will help you learn React Native throughout the semester. Here you'll find a folder for every lesson. Within each folder is a project and a README.md that will guide you step-by-step on how to build the project for that lesson.

### Curriculum Outline
1. Lesson 0: React Native Set Up
2. Lesson 1: Introduction to React Native
3. Lesson 2: Working with Components
4. Lesson 3: Networking and Navigation
5. Lesson 4: Tying Everything Together

### Using This Repo
To use this repo properly, first follow [lesson 0](lesson-0/README.md) to get Git, Node.js, and React Native setup on your machine.

For every lesson, there's a project and a README.md that corresponds to that project. The project will contain the full finished code for that lesson and the README.md will walk you step-by-step on how to build that week's project from scratch.

We hope you'll follow along our curriculum and get started building React Native apps. It's going to be a fun semester and we're glad you're a part of it!
